PCDATA - Parsed Character Data

XML parsers normally parse all the text in an XML document.

CDATA - (Unparsed) Character Data

The term CDATA is used about text data that should not be parsed by the XML parser.

Characters like "<" and "&" are illegal in XML elements.



    !DOCTYPE note defines that the root element of this document is note
    !ELEMENT note defines that the note element must contain four elements: "to,from,heading,body"
    !ELEMENT to defines the to element to be of type "#PCDATA"
    !ELEMENT from defines the from element to be of type "#PCDATA"
    !ELEMENT heading defines the heading element to be of type "#PCDATA"
    !ELEMENT body defines the body element to be of type "#PCDATA"


from a DTD point of view, all XML documents are made up by the following building blocks:

    Elements
    Attributes
    Entities
    PCDATA
    CDATA

Entities

Some characters have a special meaning in XML, like the less than sign (<) that defines the start of an XML tag.
