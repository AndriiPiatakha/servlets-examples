//	Streaming API
//	It reads and writes JSON content as discrete events. JsonReader and JsonWriter 
//	read/write the data as token, referred as JsonToken.
//
//	It is the most powerful approach among the three approaches to process JSON. 
//	It has the lowest overhead and it is quite fast in read/write operations. 
//	It is analogous to Stax parser for XML.
//
//	Tree Model
//	It prepares an in-memory tree representation of the JSON document. It builds a tree of 
//	JsonObject nodes. It is a flexible approach and is analogous to DOM parser for XML.
//
//	Data Binding
//	It converts JSON to and from POJO (Plain Old Java Object) using property accessor. 
//	Gson reads/writes JSON using data type adapters. It is analogous to JAXB parser for XML.
